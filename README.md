# Tufts Textbook Exchange
Joel Reske

## Overview
I made this in the Spring of my Freshman year as a website for Tufts Students to buy and sell textbooks. I really loved the project
and it was the first full stack app that I had really ever made so I learned a ton. I built the whole thing in PHP using Digital Ocean
and I integrated Facebook Login through PHP as my auth. I ended up scrapping the project as alternatives showed up but I'm proud of the
work I did - by the end it was a fully-functioning exchange!
